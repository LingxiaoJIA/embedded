prune functions and variables and only remain the useful functions for the edge functions listed below:
get_image(filename,in,x_size,y_size)
setup_brightness_lut(bp,thresh,form)
susan_edges(in,r,mid,bp,max_no,x_size,y_size)
susan_thin(r,mid,x_size,y_size)
edge_draw(in,mid,x_size,y_size,drawing_mode)
put_image(filename,in,x_size,y_size)

Top level behavior is Main (susan_edge_detector.sc) with three leaf behavior: Stimulus, Susan and Monitor. There are three leaf behaviors of Susan: DetectEdges, SusanThin and EdgeDraw. There are two leaf behaviors of DetectEdges: setup_brightness_lut and susan_edges.

change the malloc functions into static arrays, and change parameter of functions that uses these pointers:
These two were originally malloc in the main():
int *r[x_size * y_size * sizeof(int)];--->int r[x_size * y_size * sizeof(int)];
uchar *mid[x_size*y_size];--->uchar mid[x_size*y_size];

THESE two were allocated in input_image() and lut():
declare in main as: uchar  *in;--->uchar in[x_size * y_size];
declare in main as: uchar  *bp;--->uchar bp[516];

Set the size fixed to 76*95, and prune the parameters and ONLY left necessary for communicate: delete x_size, y_size, and hardcode the in the functions:
susan_edges(in,r,mid,bp,max_no_edges,x_size,y_size);--->
DetectEdges detect_edges(Port_stimulus, c_Edgesout);
susan_thin(r,mid,x_size,y_size);--->susan_thin(c_Thinin, c_Thinout);
edge_draw(in,mid,x_size,y_size,drawing_mode);--->edge_draw(c_Drawin, Port_monitor);
//c_Edgesout, c_Thinin, c_Thinout, c_Drawin are all c_queue channel

behavior EdgeDrawFSM
behavior Main

behavior WriteImage

The top behavior is Main, which contains Stimulus, Design and Monitor. 
Design contains ReadImage, Susan and WriteImage. 
Susan contains DetectEdgesFSM, SusanThinFSM and EdgeDrawFSM.
DetectEdgesFSM contains DetectEdges.
SusanThinFSM contains SusanThin.
EdgeDrawFSM contains EdgeDraw.
DetectEdges contains SetupBrightnessLut and SusanEdges.
EdgeDrawBlack, EdgeDrawWhite, SusanEdgesFirstLoop and SusanEdgeSecondLoop are used to apply data parallel implementation.

The commands of MAKEFILE:
% make   //To compile all files
% make test  //Run susan_edge_detector.sc and compare results with gold file.  
% make par   //Run parallel version of the test
% make list  //list all the behaviors, channels and interface that used.
